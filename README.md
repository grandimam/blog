👋 Hi

I build data-intelligence platforms — products that fetch messy data, enrich it with AI/LLMs, and expose insights via scalable APIs and apps 

🔎 My focus:  
- **Data acquisition** → crawlers, connectors, pipelines  
- **Data enrichment** → classification, recommendations, LLM + embeddings  
- **Intelligence delivery** → low-latency backends, search, dashboards, APIs  

⚡ What I enjoy most:  
- Turning unstructured data into **actionable intelligence**  
- Building **intelligent websites & platforms** (ads, e-commerce, property, cloud security)  
- Exploring how **LLMs** power the next generation of intelligent systems
